          <h2 class="text-center">"For a company our size, implementing new technology is risky."</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">Large companies face a catch-22: the organizational cost of adopting new technology is high, but so is the opportunity cost of non-adoption. At BrickHouse, we work with large organizations test new technologies in small, sandboxed environments. By doing so, our clients have concrete data about the costs and expected return of a company-wide shift in tech strategy before they pull the trigger.</p>
          <h2 class="text-center">"We kept hearing about other companies leveraging big data, but didn't have the internal resources to implement that ourselves."</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">Every big organization has access to amazing amounts of data, but rarely is this data being harnessed to help the bottom line. We help our clients build frameworks to gather, access, and interpret the vast amount of information they have at their disposal, giving corporate leadership easy access to the concrete facts of their organization.</p>
          <h2 class="text-center">"Vendors are always trying to pitch us on the latest time- or money-saving tech, but evaluating their offers isn't exactly our core competency."</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">Will a presence on Facebook actually help your business? Does your corporate leadership really need to be tweeting? Every month brings a new trend in web and marketing tech, and unless you're in silicon valley, these kinds of questions are probably not your area of expertise. BrickHouse helps our clients evaluate these emerging technologies and develop strategies for leveraging those that can actually make a difference.</p>

          <h3><img src="img/lock.png" style="width: 24px; margin-right: 10px;" />Data Management</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Big data requires smart strategies to be useful. The more data an organization has, the more it runs into two specific issues: data security and knowledge management. We work with our clients to secure and make use of their data stores, extracting and presenting relevant data so that it can be used as a powerful decision-making tool.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">We work with our clients to transform big data from "information overload" into a deep structural understanding of the hard facts of their organization. This gives corporate leadership the intel they need to guide their large enterprise.</p>

          <h3><img src="img/thunder.png" style="width: 32px; margin-right: 10px;" />Contingency Planning</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Even in the most careful production environments, things go wrong. The key to 'expecting the unexpected' is being prepared for a quick recovery. On BrickHouse servers, your site will be backed up by a layered system of failover measures designed to keep your public image consistent, no matter happens behind the scenes.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Third party caching, off-site backups, and automated DDOS protection help ensure that your service stays uninterrupted.</p>

          <h3><img src="img/clock.png" style="width: 32px; margin-right: 10px;" />Realtime Monitoring</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Big decisions require big data. BrickHouse provides realtime monitoring of both public-facing and staff-facing software. This allows our clients to use hard data to make decisions about which software tools are working to their advantage, and which are being underutilized.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Using this data, we work with our clients to optimize their tech strategy inside and out: we continually re-work their online presence so that it's as engaging as possible, while optimizing internal tools so that employees can take full advantage of the software at their disposal.</p>
